Directed Weighted Graphs : 

In this assignment we have developed a data structure, algorithms and Graphical User Interface
and display system infrastructure in a graphical window. 
The project is deals with the development of a deliberate graphed data structure.
After realizing the data structure, a number of algorithms are implemented on the graph, including short-path calculation,
strong linkage testing and short-path calculation that passes through a set of vertices.

First, we built Vertex and Edge classes that define them,
with fields that will suit us later in realizing the data structure and calculating the algorithms.

After that, we built the DGraph class that represent a directed weighted graph, there we performed several methods like:
add new vertex to the graph, connect new edge between 2 vertexes, remove vertex/edge from the graph and more.

Then, we built Graph_Algo class that represents a collection of algorithms on weighted directed graphs, there we performed some methods like:
if the graph is connected or not, what is the shortest path between 2 vertexes and more.

Finally, We've added a GuiGraph class that represents a graphical interface and allows you to view a graph,
save it, run algorithms on it, and display their results.

This assignment taught us a lot about algorithm efficiency and significantly improved our skills in object-oriented programming in general,
and inheritance and graphical interfaces in particular.
